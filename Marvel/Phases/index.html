    <h1> (2016-2019) <br> <span>Phase Three</span> </h1>
    <p class="p"> After two successful phases, the Marvel Cinematic Universe decided to truly expand with Phase 3. 
        Unlike both prior phases which each contained six films, Phase 3 nearly doubled that with 11 films. 
        Starting in 2017 the MCU output went from two films a year to three.</p>
